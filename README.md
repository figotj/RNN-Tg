# RNN-Tg
A chemical language processing model for polymer Tg prediction.

# Data
- Polymer data is manually collected from PolyInfo database which can be referred to https://polymer.nims.go.jp/en/ (National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS) holds the copyright of this database system).
- High-temperature polymer data with predictions using the model is available here.

# model
Chemical language processing model (embedding and RNN/DNN) for polymer Tg prediction.
